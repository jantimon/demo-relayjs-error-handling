A minimal React + Relay GraphQL demo with Vite dev server GraphQL endpoint

## Features

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Relay** for GraphQL data fetching with fragments
- **Vite middleware** for GraphQL API endpoint (works in all environments)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

```

The demo will start at `http://localhost:5173` with Vite dev server handling GraphQL requests at `/graphql`.

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/            # Mock movie data
â”œâ”€â”€ __generated__/   # Auto-generated Relay types
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx         # Main app with Relay provider
â”œâ”€â”€ Movies.tsx      # Movies list with Relay query
â”œâ”€â”€ Movie.tsx       # Individual movie with Relay fragment
â””â”€â”€ RelayEnvironment.ts  # Relay configuration
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Component-based data requirements** - Each component defines its own GraphQL fragment
- **Automatic type generation** - TypeScript types generated from GraphQL schema
- **Mock-first development** - Vite middleware handles GraphQL requests, no backend needed
- **Clean component hierarchy** - App â†’ Movies â†’ Movie with proper data flow

## GraphQL Schema

Simple movie database schema with:
- `movies` query for listing all movies
- `movie(id)` query for individual movies
- Movie type with title, director, year, genre, rating, and description

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npx relay-compiler   # Regenerate Relay types
```
